#To create a class, use the keyword class:
#Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:
class MyClass:
  x = 5 

#Create an object named p1, and print the value of x:
p1 = MyClass()
print(p1.x) 

#Delete the p1 object:
del p1

#Example

#Create three objects from the MyClass class:
p1 = MyClass()
p2 = MyClass()
p3 = MyClass()

print(p1.x)
print(p2.x)
print(p3.x) 

#class definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a class definition with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.
class Person:
